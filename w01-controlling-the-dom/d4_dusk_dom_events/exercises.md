### Hijack Click
Hijack the big red button on the [GA homepage](https://generalassemb.ly/)!  
- When you click the button...
1. prevent the default link behavior, and print "Clicked!" to the console.
2. use `$(this)` to change the text of the link to say "1".
3. Display the number of times the link has been clicked. If I click it again it should say "2".
