#Ruby <3's OOP

##Learning Objectives
By the end of lesson, students will be able to...

* Distinguish between objects & classes in Ruby
* Initialize classes
* Define attributes & instance methods
* Distinguish between instance and class variables

##Hashes (10m)

Let's create a new Hash

* Hashes are simple key/value stores.

**Challenge:**
How can I organize my data using key/value pairs in Ruby? Like so:

```ruby
# hash rocket notation
# accessed like hash["key"] #=> value
hash = {"name"=>"Napoleon", "fav_food"=>"steak", "skills"=>["archery", "combat", "egg farming"]}
hash["name"] #=> "Napoleon"
hash['skills'].first #=> "archery"
test =  { 0 => "Zero", 1 => "One", 2 => "Two" }
test[0] #=> "Zero"

website = { 'url' => 'http://myblog.wordpress.com', 'author' => 'Melissa ', 'likes' => 3000 }
website['url'] #=> 'http://myblog.wordpress.com'
website['likes'] #=> 3000

# symbol notation, use this more often
# accessed like hash[:key] #=> value
agent = {name: "James Bond", fav_food: "Vodka Martini",
skills: ["hand to hand combat", "marksmanship", "espionage"]}

agent[:name] #=> "James Bond"
agent[:skills] #=> ["hand to hand combat", "marksmanship", "espionage"]
```

##Objects (10m)

- Everything in Ruby is an Object; however, we almost never use plain vanilla Objects because there are more sophisticated implementations of them such a `String`, `Array`, `Integer`, and `Hash`.

- Different objects provide different types of functionality for storing data and performing behaviors. However, for more complex applications, classes (a certain kind of object) are used to model real-world interactions.

**Challenge:**
How can we prove that the Hash we just created inherited from `Basic Object`?

*Hint:* use the `#is_a?` method


###Class Inheritance Tree

![Class inheritance](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rvcEi.png)

##Classes (10m)

**Challenge:**
How do we create a class in Ruby?

Goal: Let's create a Car that goes "Vroom" when it's first *initialized*

*Refresher: Classes are datatypes used to create more data. They are analogous to constructors in JavaScript.*

##Attributes (10m)

What should we do if we want to set attributes on the car, such as a paint color and year?

**Challenge:**
Enable this code...

```ruby
fiat = Car.new
fiat.color = "hot pink"
fiat.color
=> "hot pink"
```

*Hint: Use `attr_accessor`.*

*Bonus: Don't use `attr_accessor`*

##Methods (10m)

**Challenge:**
How would we create an instance method `color?` for our `Car` class instances, which tests whether the color matches what is passed in?

**Note:** Methods ending in `?` are conventionally used to denote that they return a boolean value. [Source](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#naming)

```ruby
alpha = Car.new
alpha.color = "orange"
alpha.color?("blue")
=> false
alpha.color?("orange")
=> true
```

*Hint: define a new method with the `def` keyword inside the class*

##Initialization & Instance Variables (10m)

**Challenge:**
What if I want to set the color of the car at the moment I'm creating it? How could I enable code like this?

```ruby
lambo = Car.new("red")
lambo.color
=> "red"
```

*Hint: Create an instance variable with `@`*

##Class Variables (10m)

What if I wanted a running counter for all the cars I've ever created? Enable the code: `Car.total` which outputs the total number of all cars ever created.

*Hint: Create a class variable with `@@` to store the count and use the `self` keyword to add a class method*

*Note: Class variables are used much more infrequently than instance variables*

## Quick Review (15m)

Think, pair, share...

  * What is a class?
    - What is an attribute?
    - What is a method?
  * What is the difference between:
    - an instance variable,
    - a class variable
  * Why do we use classes?
  * What is inheritance?

## Inheritance (25m)

Given an `Vehicle` class that contains the method `accelerate` & attribute `speed`..

```ruby
class Vehicle
  attr_accessor :speed
  def initialize
  	@speed = 0
  end
  def accelerate(speed)
  	@speed += speed
  end
end
```

**Challenge:**
How can I create both `Car` and `Motorbike` classes while being DRY and not duplicating the method `accelerate` in each?

## Exercise: Characters and Superheroes

Previously you worked with using inheritance to create some `Animal` and `People` classes. This exercise will review those concepts, using the `Character` and `Superhero` classes.

Superheroes are still Characters after all. In this exercise, you'll define:

  1. A `Character` class, with the following:
    * Attributes (instance variables defined in initialize method):
      * `name`: A string that holds the character's name
    * Instance Methods:
      * `location`: Takes a parameter `origin` prints out a message telling the character's `name` and where they are from (their `origin`)
      * `exercise` & `rest`: These two methods should NOT be passed any arguments. Instead, they will set an instance variable `@state` to the string `"ready"` or `"tired"` respectively.
    - *Note:* What type of `attr` method will be needed to `read` the name and state variables?

  2. A `Superhero` class, with the following characteristics:
    * Inherits from `Character`
    * Adds 2 new instance variables (which initialize takes as arguments):
      * `charisma`
      * `secret_identity`
    * initializes using `super`, passing `name` as an argument
    - Adds 2 new methods:
      - `persuade`, which
        - takes another instance of the `Superhero` class as an argument
        - compares charisma of the character using the method to the character passed to the method as an argument *Hint: use if / else*
        - prints a message stating whether the character calling the method was able to persuade the other character or not
      - `study_rhetoric`, which increments `charisma` and optionally prints a message about the character's new charisma level
    - Superheroes must keep their identities secret! Make sure your `Superhero` class *overrides* the existing `greet` method (in `Character`) so that a `Superhero` doesn't reveal their true `"name"`

**BONUS:**

* Sometimes superheroes must reveal who they are to the public. Add an instance method called `reveal` that prints out a superhero's name and the secret identity they used in the following format: "I am Green Arrow. But you know me better as Oliver Queen." (Hint: look up how to interpolate strings in Ruby)
 * Add a `class variable` called `count` that keeps track of all the superheroes you create.

 **Stretch** (no solution)

 Create a `Lollipop` class that has an attribute of  `diameter`, a random integer between 1 and 5.

 Create a `Tree` class that has the attribute `fruits`, which is an array, the attribute `age!`, which starts at 0, and the attribute `dead`, which should be a boolean.

 - `Tree#dead?` should print a message about the age of the tree or a message that the tree is dead based on the value of `dead` attribute.
 - `Tree#bloom` should initialize a random number of Lollipops (with random diameters) and add them to the tree's `fruits` array
 - `Tree#age!` should
    - change the tree's `dead` attribute to `true` if the tree is over a certain age
    - print a message about the tree being dead based on `Tree#dead?`
 - `Tree#age!` should increment the tree's age by 1 (if the tree is alive) and optionally print the tree's `age`.
 - `Tree#age!` should invoke the `bloom method`.
