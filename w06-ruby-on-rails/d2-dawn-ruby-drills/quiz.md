1. Name three of your favorite and most effective debugging techniques.

**PROJECT 1 Review**

1. Write a brief step by step of what workflow process you ended up doing for Project 1. For example, maybe you wrote user narratives first, then drew a schema drawing, and then started templating. Feel free to reference your Project 1 code and materials and break up your answer by day.
1. Write what workflow do you wish you had done and what will your workflow look like in future projects?
1. Recall a problem you had or are having with your project 1 and write a sample stackoverflow.com question. Remember to include
  1. What you're trying to accomplish
  1. What you've tried already
  1. What error you are receiving or problem you are having
  1. Relevant, brief code samples

**Resourcefulness**

1. Although you might know nothing about Python, imagine you've been asked by your employer or client to find the best Django module for doing authentication. (Django is like Rails but built in python). Pick the Django module you'd use and list the pros and cons of why to use or not use it and why you think it is the best.
