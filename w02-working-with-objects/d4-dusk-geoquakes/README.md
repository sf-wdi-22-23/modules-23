# GeoQuakes Lab -- AJAX + Google Maps

| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Practice AJAX with the USGS Earthquake API |
| Follow the Google Maps tutorial & problem solve adding pins to a map |

### GeoQuakes Lab

This afternoon we will be doing two API integrations (aka an "API Mashup"):  
- We'll consume JSON data from the USGS for Weekly Significant Earthquakes.
- We'll integrate with the Google Maps API to display a map and pins.

To begin, please clone the [GeoQuakes Lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/geoquakes) and follow the readme instructions there.

Solutions can be found in the [Solutions Branch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/geoquakes/tree/solution).
