###Quick Challenge
- Copy the object above and save it to a javaScript file, `data.js`
- Add some properties that logically fit into an object describing our class (address, floor number, and a list of instructors.
- Run your file using 'node data.js' in your console.
- Add some lines to 'data.js' to console.log some of your new properties!

If everything worked out, you should have a fully functioning data object, only now with even MORE properties with us to play with!


###Quick Challenge - She loves me, she loves me not...
Create an object method for flower that will play the age old game ['He loves me, he loves me not...'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_loves_me..._he_loves_me_not)
- Count down from the petal number down to 1
- Alternately display 'He loves me' or 'He loves me not' to the console for each petal count decrement.
- Display the final phrase with an exclamation; that's the end of the game!


There are many more aspects to objects that we will discover tomorrow.  For now, play with objects and think up some great object examples that we might use in class.
