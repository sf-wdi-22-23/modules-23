# Practicing AJAX

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

You're about to write a lot of AJAX-backed JavaScript – using either jQuery or Vanilla JS, if you're feeling confident – that will complete our little Doughnut Shop app.

Make use of the fantastic and delicious https://api.doughnuts.ga.  Your task is to use your JS skills to list out all the doughnuts in our database and get our form working so we can add more.

> Note: Keep in mind, this API doesn't persist (so that other students can use it, too), but it does _act_ like it. When you create a new doughnut, it'll show you results as if that doughnut was persisted. Make use of it!


## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Implement a jQuery AJAX client for a simple REST service
- Build an application that uses AJAX to update a client
- Update an existing API resource from your client with new data
- Destroy an existing API resource from your client

#### Starter Code

You'll find the same starter code you had in the last lesson in the `starter-code` folder. It's a basic index and some styling, along with an empty `js/app.js`.

#### Deliverable

Make a list of existing doughnuts underneath the form, make the form work, and then, build your app to add to the list of donuts - using the information from newly created donuts - without refreshing the page.
