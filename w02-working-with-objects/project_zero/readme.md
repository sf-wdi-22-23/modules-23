## Summary

Imagine you want to let people write really short public blog posts. The homepage of your microblog app should be a list of these micro-posts with a form to add a new one. We don't have a backend yet, so we won't be worrying about login, users, followers, and all of that good stuff quite yet. But we can create new blog posts, have them added to the page!

## Basic Requirements

| Concepts | Tools |
| :------: | :---: | :-----: |
| User Stories, OOP | Bootstrap, jQuery, Git, Kanban Board |

1. Make your basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">user narrative</a>, <a href="http://www.re-vision.com/webwork/p27wireframes/drawing_small.jpg">wireframe</a>, and Kanban board. These are required!
2. Start by cloning the basic template and renaming the folder to micro-blog. CD into micro-blog and than run 'git init'. Then run "git commit -m 'initial commit'". Create a new public repo on your github, and DO NOT create the readme. Follow the instructions to push an existing repository from the command line.

3. Make frequent commits and pushes (every hour or so). You should commit every time you add a new feature, and it is working! A feature can be something as small as adding a little style. Add a very short README.md that outlines what your app does and the libraries you are using.
3. Use default Bootstrap classes with minimal custom CSS.
4. Make a list of `posts` using HTML strings, JavaScript and jQuery (and Object Oriented Programming!) that render to the DOM.
5. Make a form to add new `posts` to the list using jQuery.
6. Be sure to comment your code, and make the code clean (mind spacing and indentation).

## Stretch Challenges (optional)

* Add a count of how many posts have been posted that updates every time a new post is created.
* Add a Bootstrap JS component like a tooltip.
* Add more custom CSS to make it very beautiful :)
* Add `Model` object that saves `posts` to `localStorage`. A Model is an object that handles persistent data.
* Add `comments` on `posts`.
* These get tricky, but you DO have a long weekend. :)

* [The Solution](https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/Project-0-Solution/tree/master) lives here. "Wait until you have a hole in your brain the shape of the answer, before you look at the answer." Optimize for your own learning, NOT for "getting an A" that doesn't exist.

### Need more to do?
1. Check out [this excellent talk](https://vimeo.com/105955605) in which Mary Rose Cook live codes Space Invaders from scratch in 30 minutes. She's using HTML Canvas, which is a HTML5 element that is cool. Don't worry about understanding it all, just watch in awe and appreciation, and follow along as best you can. 
2. Check out [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html), particularly Chapter 6, on Objects. The earlier chapters can be great for review as well.
